# App Description
This cv app is made as a demonstration of rendering the HTML Elements with the content, dynamically rendered 
from the JSON file, which is requested from the server, while the empty page is on the client side.

## Task: 
- Using vanilla JS, without libraries, to realize the CV App which will dynamically construct the 
HTMLElements from the fetched JSON file, and re-render the HTMLElements on the events, connected to the 
data or chosen filters;
- All the UI elements (lists, paragraphs, filters, etc) should be rendered according to the JSON data;
- The fetched data should be stored in the localStorage for 24 hours, avoiding repeated http requests to the
server;
- To renew the LocalStorage, if the creation date of the LocalStorage is more than 24 hours; 
- To set the LocalStorage with the image, fetched from the JSON data url and read with FileReader;
- If the fetched JSON data contains refs on pdf files to be downloaded,  
then to create downloadable <a> links with href to the fetched pdf files; <br>
The pdf files for the <a> links should be fetched and stored separately;
- Fetched pdf files should be stored in the LocalStorage for the next sessions; <br>
The files should be also validated with the creation date and restored if
necessary;
- Resembling React, to implement Classes/Components, which shall comprise the logic and the markup/styles of 
the App. <br>
The link to the code is available in the section "Experience";
- The Class/Component can return the HTMLElement and has the methods to handle the corresponding data;
- Finally, bundled in the App container, it will be appended to the '#root' DOM Element of the initial empty page;
- No hardcoded names and elements UI;
- The initial render of the App is empty with the only 'loading' icon;
- To make adoptive html on desktop and mobile screens;
- To imitate the loading time, showing the loading icon, when fetching the data;
- On choosing the filter, the components must be re-rendered with the new data;
- To visually demonstrate the level of knowledge and skills with the indicating bar from 0 to 100%;
- On scrolling the page down, the filter`s bar must emerge on the top of the page in the fixed position 
in order to be accessible in the scrolled page;
- On re-rendering the data to scroll up the page to zero position;
- To make animation of the scrolling text on the top of the page;

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

#### `npm run watch`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
It re-renders the page on changing the code;

#### `npm run dev`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
The Bundler will create the 'dist' directory without hash names and optimizations;

#### `npm run build`
